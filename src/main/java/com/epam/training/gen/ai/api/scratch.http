### Module 3. Work with Different Models

### Request 3.1 gpt-4 deployment name with 0.1 temperature

A man needs a woman because life is like a sock drawer – without her, it's just a bunch of unmatched socks!
Plus, who else is going to remind him that the milk he's about to drink expired a week ago? And let's be honest,
a woman brings balance to his life, like a good Wi-Fi signal in a dead zone – suddenly, everything just works better!

Sure! Here are some pros and cons of microservice architecture, with a touch of humor:

### Pros:

1. **Scalability**:
    - You can scale up individual microservices independently, kind of like upgrading your coffee machine without redesigning the whole kitchen.

2. **Flexibility**:
   - Different teams can use different tech stacks, which means you can have a "Java island" and a "Node.js beachfront" at the same time.

3. **Resilience**:
   - One microservice crashing doesn’t bring down the whole system, similar to how one bad joke in a stand-up routine doesn’t necessarily ruin the entire show.

4. **Faster Deployment**:
   - Smaller codebases mean quicker iterations and faster deployments. It's like cooking mini-pizzas instead of full-sized ones – they get ready faster!

5. **Focused Teams**:
   - Each team can focus on a specific service, meaning they can become experts in their little domain. It’s like having a master chef for each course in a meal.

### Cons:

1. **Complexity**:
    - Managing a bunch of microservices can get as complicated as trying to keep track of all the characters.

To convert 8395 days into minutes, we need to know that there are 24 hours in a day and 60 minutes in an hour.

First, let's find the number of hours in 8395 days: 8395 days * 24 hours/day = 201,480 hours.

Now, to find the number of minutes, we multiply the number of hours by 60: 201,480 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 12,088,800 minutes.

Therefore, 8395 days is equal to 12,088,800 minutes.
